## Description 
In our group project, we address the visual room rearrangement challenge, which consists of two stages: Walkthrough and Unshuffle, where an agent notes object positions and then adjusts them after environmental changes. Utilizing RGBD data and camera pose, we propose a novel method to generate 3D bounding boxes.

## Pipeline 
![Pipeline](images/pipeline.png)

 As shown in the figure, we achieve the generation of 3D bounding boxes using a multi-step process that begins with the acquisition of RGB and depth images from a depth-sensing camera. Initially, the system loads and processes these images to prepare them for further analysis. The primary step involves applying an object detection algorithm to the RGB images to identify and outline objects in 2D bounding boxes. These 2D boxes are then integrated with the corresponding depth data. The crucial aspect of this integration is the transformation of these 2D boxes into 3D space, which is facilitated by the known position and orientation of the camera. Functions for creating rotation matrices and mapping camera coordinates to world coordinates are employed to achieve this spatial transformation.
